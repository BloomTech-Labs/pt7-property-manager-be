# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend delpoyed at Heroku (https://property-manager-be.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm run test** to start server using testing environment

### Backend framework goes here

- We chose Node/Express to make our backend server. This was mainly because of the Lambda Labs standards and familiarity.
- For our database, we used postgresql and knex, for the same reasons.
